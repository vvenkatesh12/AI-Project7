This project explores one of the fundamental algorithms in generative AI: the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Through a combination of guided implementation and open-ended exploration, students will build a deep understanding of how VAEs work and how they can be extended for different applications. This project follows a "learn by doing" philosophy. Students begin with a basic implementation that works, then gradually modify and extend it to understand the underlying principles and explore advanced concepts.
